## üêç Python File Organizer

A simple Python automation tool that organizes your messy folders (like your Downloads folder) into neatly categorized subfolders ‚Äî automatically! <br>
This project uses the built-in os and shutil modules to move files based on their extensions (images, documents, zips, programs, etc.).

---

## How It Works

1. The program reads every file in the target folder. <br>
2. It checks the file‚Äôs extension and matches it to a category. <br>
3. It automatically creates the necessary subfolders (if not already existing). <br>
4. Files are then moved to their respective folders using shutil.move(). <br>
